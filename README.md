Q: what is your site's theme?

A: the site's theme could be considered "webcore," or if u ever owned a DS... it's kinda inspired by pictochat lmao. im not sure what term to use rn but i love stuff like san-x, q-lia, and different styles of harajuku, japanese street fashion, and it's subcultures. (think gyaru, lolita, etc.) those could be the general theme of the site.
